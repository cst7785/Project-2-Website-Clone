# Project-2-Website-Clone

## Introduction
Project 2 involves reverse engineering a website to replicate a few of its key features.
I chose the website YouTube.com, and wanted to replicate the homepage, search bar, and the video show page with comments.

## Technologies
For this project, we are using a MEN stack, consisting of MongoDB, Express, and Node, hosted on Hiroku.

## MVP
The MVP for this project is being able to render the Home Page, being able to search the database for videos and display search results, displaying a vieo show page, and being able to leave a comment on the video.
